#HackRU Fall 2015 Project
Presenting: Hangout and Chill, a web app created during the 2015 Hackathon at
Rutgers

#Technologies:
The backend uses NodeJS(Express) and MongoDB.  This was my first time using MongoDB,
and the most complete NodeJS project I have created.

The Web Front-end uses html, jade, and jQuery as well as the Google Maps API.  
The Front-end is used primarily to demonstrate the backend's capabilities
